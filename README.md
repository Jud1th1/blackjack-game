## My process
-	To begin with I followed the tutorial to lay out my html and css
-	There were JS practice throughout to help understand the concepts we would be using which helped with understanding my JS set up
-	We started off by creating two variables for our cards and and setting the sum of the two cards
-	We crated blackjack rules such as:
-	if less than or equal to 20 -> "Do you want to draw a new card? ðŸ™‚"
-	// else if exactly 21 -> "Wohoo! You've got Blackjack! ðŸ¥³"
-	// else -> "You're out of the game! ðŸ˜­"
-	Then we introduced a new variable that keeps the state of the game so we know if our player has Blackjack 
-	If our player is â€˜aliveâ€™ we assign a variable to true to allow the â€˜dealerâ€™ to continue dealing cards
-	We reassigned the message variable to the string to log it out
-	Then we crated a startGame function and started to set up the game display, so allowing JS to store messages, display them, find sum, and display our cards using functions and getElementby Id
-	We created a new Card button that would be able to draw random cards as created a for loop that renders out all the cards instead of just two 
-	We fixed the new card function to stop it from letting user to continue getting cards after a loss
-	Then finally we added another variable called chips to the game which we grouped with the players name â€“ so we created an an object to store player data, gave it two keys, name and chips, and set their values
-	Then I added some final styling edits such as a new image to the background and a box shadow around the container of my game. I changed some colors and fonts and made sure the game was responsive for mobile as well. 



### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Desktop-mobile workflow


### What I learned

-	I learned how build a game with JS
-   I learned how to create arrays, use for loops, return values, objects, etc. 



### Continued development

I plan to practice more JavaScript projects
